# Cooking Lessons by Noah

### About

Welcome to Cooking with Noah, where you can learn how to cook at a reasonable price. See [final_reflection.md]() for more info about the making and process of this project.

### Proposal

One of my hobbies, when I'm not pulling all-nighters or playing games, is cooking. My dad was a chef and I enjoy cooking from both a practical and an artistic/expressive perspective. I believe that cooking is a valuable skill and I have a private Snap story where I post step-by-step instructions as I cook sometimes. I routinely get people asking about how to cook, so I've considered at one point or another when my bank account is hovering around $0 hosting a class/instructional service for a small fee where I teach people the basics of ingredient selection, prep work, cooking technique, and walk them through the actual process of cooking the food. For my visual argument, I'd like to make a poster/social media assets (either one or a series, think when you're on Instagram or Snapchat swiping or tapping through things formatted for a mobile phone screen) to advertise this semi-hypothetical service. I'll be using pictures of food and such to illustrate the types of things and techniques I can teach. I might even include a free sampler of a lesson in this. Another fun direction would be some visual stuff that gets across the benefits of cooking for yourself.

### Assets
