# Snapshot 3/2/21 

Today I have completed basic picture selection and started on a preliminary poster concept with a simple gradient background. It took a while just to put together all the reasonably good looking pictures of food I have made including the ones that have steps included, so they're currently a bit unorganized in a folder. (`assets/original/unsorted_dump`). This will be rectified later once I prune which ones I want to use more. I may also increase the size of the poster to make more of a pamphlet that would fold rather than just a poster. I think this would let me fit more text information, and maybe a sample recipe optionally. I chose a darker color like purple because I think it draws attention to the photographs and text. May need to play with text colors and fonts more later. Right now all this basically shows is the title of my project/classes "Cooking Lessons with Noah," and some of the things I would be teaching people as part of this program. I may tweak this more later and perhaps have it on its own "side" of the pamphlet with explanatory pictures for each item on the list, or something like that. This is still in an early exploratory stage for me, so I will be playing with it more over the next few days when I get some more time to work on it. I may also take some new pictures next time I go shopping to illustrate the ingredient/equipment selection stuff. Not really sure what those pictures would be yet. I might actually take some pictures and do some light edits on them to emphasize traits someone would pay attention to when selecting vegetables, meat, or fish for example.
